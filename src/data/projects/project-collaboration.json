  "longDescription": "A common challenge in academic institutions is that students often work on projects or ideas in isolation, and there is no central platform to showcase these initiatives or seek collaboration. The GECian Archive was built to solve this by providing a digital platform where students at GEC Palakkad can showcase their academic and personal projects, describe the kind of help or mentorship they need, and connect with others who are interested in contributing. Built with Next.js and Node.js, the platform allows users to upload project details, link to source code, share presentations, and browse the work of their peers. Interested students can reach out directly to collaborate, fostering a culture of innovation, teamwork, and knowledge-sharing across the college."
