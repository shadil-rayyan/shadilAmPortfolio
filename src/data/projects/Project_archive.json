  "longDescription": "A common challenge in academic institutions is the lack of a centralized platform for students to showcase their work, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and missed collaboration opportunities. The GECian Archive was built to solve this by providing a digital repository for students at GEC Palakkad to archive their academic and personal projects. The goal is to foster a culture of collaboration and allow students to build a portfolio of their work. Built with Next.js and Node.js, the platform allows users to upload project details, link to source code, share presentations, and browse the work of their peers, creating a lasting digital legacy of innovation at the college."
