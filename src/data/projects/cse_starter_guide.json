  "longDescription": "The CSE Starter Guide is a student-created resource designed to help first-year Computer Science students navigate the challenges of their initial year. Many new students miss important concepts, resources, or opportunities due to the fast-paced curriculum and limited orientation. This guide consolidates key knowledge, tips, and recommendations from senior students, providing insights on what to focus on, useful resources, and best practices for academic and extracurricular success. Built as an accessible, easy-to-navigate platform, the CSE Starter Guide aims to bridge the knowledge gap, help students catch up on what they missed, and empower them to make the most of their first year in the program."
