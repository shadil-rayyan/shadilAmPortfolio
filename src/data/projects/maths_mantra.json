  "longDescription": "z.Mantra is an inclusive Android math learning app designed for both visually impaired and sighted learners. The app combines audio-based guidance, gesture-based interactions, and playful math challenges to make math education engaging and accessible. Built in Kotlin with accessibility-first design, z.Mantra delivers multiple interactive modes including Bell Ring, Drum Play, Drawing, Touch Count, Stereo Sound, Number Line, MCQs, Compass Navigation, Day Calculation, and Mental Math.\n\nInspired by the GSoC 2024 Math Mantra project, I rebuilt and expanded the app from the ground up, refactoring architecture, UX flows, and implementation in Kotlin while adding new modes such as Quick Play, Learning Mode, and Game Mode. I implemented a robust hints system, custom accessibility services, and expanded gameplay logic to ensure an engaging and barrier-free learning experience.\n\nThe app uses MVVM architecture for a decoupled, testable structure, Glide and Lottie for smooth visuals and animations, Apache POI for dynamic Excel-based question loading, exp4j for math evaluation, and TTS for spoken guidance. Accessibility highlights include full TalkBack support, haptic and auditory feedback, custom gestures, and high-contrast Dark Mode for low-vision users.\n\nThrough developing z.Mantra, I gained deep experience in accessibility-focused UX, Android architecture, dynamic data handling, and designing interactive learning experiences. The project strengthened my ability to build scalable, user-centric educational apps that combine fun, pedagogy, and inclusivity. Future enhancements include user-defined questions, an accessible custom keyboard, multiplayer modes, drawing answer recognition, and spatial reasoning exercises for tactile visual learners. Developed as part of GSoC 2025 Zendalona, z.Mantra is now a fully functional, modern, and inclusive math learning app."
