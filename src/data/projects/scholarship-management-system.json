  "longDescription": "The Scholarship Management System is a full-stack web application I developed to streamline and automate the scholarship lifecycle for both students and administrators. The manual, paper-based process was inefficient, error-prone, and lacked transparency, so I built this system to digitize applications, reviews, and notifications. Using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase for authentication, and PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM) for the database, I created a scalable and modern architecture that supports real-time updates and secure data management.\n\nThrough this project, I learned how to design and implement a complex full-stack system, integrating frontend, backend, and database layers efficiently. I gained practical experience in structuring scalable web applications, handling authentication and authorization securely, and building a responsive and user-friendly interface. Working on this project also strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of thinking about both user experience and system maintainability.\n\nFrom an architectural perspective, I focused on modular, reusable components, clean separation of concerns, and maintainable database schema design. This project enhanced my ability to plan, implement, and optimize web applications, and it gave me valuable insights into balancing technical complexity with usability. Overall, the Scholarship Management System reflects my growth as a developer, my ability to handle end-to-end project development, and my approach to building practical, real-world solutions that save time and improve efficiency."
