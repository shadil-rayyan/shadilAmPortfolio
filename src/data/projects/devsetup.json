  "longDescription": "DevSetup is a web-based tool that automates the setup of developer environments by generating installation scripts tailored to the user's operating system and preferred package manager. Developers can select their OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux), choose a package manager (e.g., Homebrew, Chocolatey, APT), and pick the tools they want installed. The tool then generates a ready-to-run script (.sh or .bat) that installs the selected tools automatically, ensuring a consistent and complete development setup.\n\nThis project simplifies the often time-consuming and error-prone process of configuring a new development environment. It supports a wide range of developer tools, organizes them into categories (IDEs, utilities, version control, etc.), and provides options to copy or download the generated script for easy use. By structuring the data in JSON and allowing updates through Excel, DevSetup is highly maintainable and scalable for future additions.\n\nWorking on DevSetup enhanced my understanding of cross-platform development, React/Next.js frontend workflows, dynamic script generation, and user-centric design. I learned how to create a seamless interface that abstracts complexity while maintaining flexibility for developers, and how to architect a system that integrates structured data with automated workflows. Overall, DevSetup saves time, reduces setup errors, and provides a consistent environment for individual developers and teams alike."
