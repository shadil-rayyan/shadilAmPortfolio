  "longDescription": "Finding safe and convenient hostels or PG accommodations near college campuses can be a challenge for students, with information scattered across multiple sources. The Nearby Hostel platform was built to solve this problem by providing a centralized digital repository of nearby hostels and PGs. The goal is to help students easily explore accommodation options, compare facilities, and make informed decisions. Built with Next.js and Node.js, the platform allows users to view detailed hostel information, browse photos, check amenities, read reviews, and contact owners directly, creating a reliable and user-friendly guide for students seeking nearby accommodations."
