  "longDescription": "Plantologica is a smart IoT-powered soil monitoring system integrated with a mobile application to help farmers and plant owners maintain optimal plant health. The system combines an ESP32 microcontroller with soil sensors to measure key parameters such as soil moisture, nutrient concentration (NPK), and pH levels. Data from the sensors is transmitted to a mobile application where users select their plant type, and the app compares real-time readings with ideal ranges, presenting results in a clear side-by-side format and generating actionable recommendations for watering, fertilization, and soil treatment.\n\nI was responsible for leading the project as both Project Manager and Developer, overseeing the hardware and mobile app integration. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in IoT system design, real-time sensor data handling, mobile application development, and rule-based recommendation engines. I learned how to structure a modular system that bridges hardware and software, and how to translate sensor data into meaningful, actionable insights for end users.\n\nThe architecture consists of soil sensors connected to an ESP32 controller, which communicates via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi with the mobile application. The app then references a knowledge base of optimal soil conditions per plant species to generate intelligent suggestions. This project strengthened my skills in embedded systems, firmware programming, mobile app development, and system integration while reinforcing the importance of user-centric design.\n\nPlantologica aims to reduce guesswork in plant care, support precision agriculture, and promote sustainable farming practices. Future enhancements include historical data tracking, weather-based irrigation recommendations, AI-powered crop insights, and multi-plant farm monitoring, making it a comprehensive digital assistant for plant health management."
