  "longDescription": "Tech Expert was a fully manual Telegram bot I built to help users quickly find the best gadget deals during major online sales on Amazon and Flipkart. Instead of relying on scraping or automation, I personally researched discounts — often checking YouTube deal streams and browsing sales — and then updated the bot with accurate and timely offers. This way, users didn’t have to spend the same amount of time searching, as the bot served as a curated feed of top deals with direct purchase links.\n\nThe concept worked well in saving users effort, but the project faced challenges. Because everything was updated manually, it required significant time and effort to keep the bot current. At the same time, I underestimated the importance of marketing and building a user base, so adoption remained limited. The combination of manual effort and lack of promotion made it hard to scale.\n\nEven though Tech Expert did not grow into a successful product, it gave me valuable lessons. I learned how important it is to think about scalability early, to balance product development with marketing, and to always consider whether my own workflow can realistically support the product long-term. These lessons continue to shape how I approach new projects today."
