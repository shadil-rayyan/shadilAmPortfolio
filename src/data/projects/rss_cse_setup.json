  "longDescription": "rss_cse_picker is a lightweight service that provides a ready-to-use OPML file containing curated RSS/Atom feeds for Computer Science and related topics. Users can instantly download the OPML file and import it into any feed reader, such as Feedly, Inoreader, or Thunderbird, without worrying about JSON, Excel, or conversion scripts. \n\nFor developers and contributors, feeds are maintained in a simple Excel file (feeds.xlsx) and converted into OPML via a Node.js script. The workflow involves editing feeds.xlsx, running a converter script to generate feeds.json, and then transforming it into feeds.opml for end-users. A detailed CONTRIBUTING.docx is included to guide new contributors through this process.\n\nThis project streamlines feed consumption for students and developers by providing curated, categorized content effortlessly. It also offers maintainers a simple way to manage and update feeds, and a clear, low-friction contribution workflow for developers, combining usability, maintainability, and collaborative development in one project."
