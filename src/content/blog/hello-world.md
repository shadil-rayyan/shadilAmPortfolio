# Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! In this article, I'll share the journey of building my portfolio website.

## Why Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 brings some incredible features like improved hydration, faster builds, and better support for React Server Components.

```typescript
function HelloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello from Next.js 15!");
}
```

## Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Built with the latest Next.js features.
- **MDX Support**: Write technical content with ease.
- **Dark Mode**: Because every developer loves dark mode.

Stay tuned for more updates!
